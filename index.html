        <p>Kaggle hosted a <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/dstl-satellite-imagery-feature-detection">satellite imagery feature detection challenge</a> in late 2016, and while it wasn't realistic to compete while I'm still learning the basics, it still posed a good exercise for applying the fundamentals of image processing and image analysis. I plan to return to this data set periodically as I learn more.</p>

          <p>I wanted to try my hand at d3, and I also wanted to get a sense of what kind of features were included in my dataset, and what it looks like in real life...</p>

        <div class="slide" id="s3">
          <p>This was easier said than done, when you account for the images being stored as 16-bit, polygons scaled according to a separate file, and repeated failures in parsing WKT format...</p>

          <p>Eventually I got it to render, and I think I finally have enough of an understanding of the data to start the analysis.</p>

          <h2>Analysis (slide right)</h2>
          <p>I wanted to start off small, so I tried to see what I could do with just the tree data</p>
          <p>I started off performing Principle Component Analysis (PCA), a process entailing compressing the dimensions with minimal information loss to more easily find trends.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
          <p>I did this and then divided my dataset between trees and not trees, and drew histograms of the two.</p>

            <figcaption>Figure 2: Histogram of Not Trees data on 0th Axis, RGB values</figcaption>
          </figure>
          </div>
          <p>Unfortunately, the shapes of my histograms are too close to really differentiate.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="slide">
          <p>So let's try some texture analysis then</p>
          <div class="analysis-mgs">

          </div>
          <p>This isn't terrible until you get to the cities, where it really has trouble telling trees from non-trees.</p>
