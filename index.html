        <p>Kaggle hosted a satellite imagery feature detection challenge in late 2016, and while it wasn't realistic to compete while I'm still learning the basics, it still posed a good exercise for applying the fundamentals of image processing and image analysis. I plan to return to this data set periodically as I learn more.</p>

          <p>This was easier said than done, when you account for the images being stored as 16-bit, polygons scaled according to a separate file, and repeated failures in parsing WKT format...</p>

          <p>Eventually I got it to render, and I think I finally have enough of an understanding of the data to start the analysis.</p>
